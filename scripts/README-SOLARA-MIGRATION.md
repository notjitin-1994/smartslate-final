## Running the Migration

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your database connection is configured in `.env`
2. Make sure you have the required environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```

### Execute Migration

Run the migration using the npm script:

```bash
npm run migrate:solara
```

Or directly with tsx:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-solara-table.ts
```

### Verification

After running the migration, you should see:

1. âœ… Success message confirming table creation
2. ðŸ“‹ Table structure listing all columns
3. ðŸ”— Confirmation that the table is ready to receive submissions

## API Integration

The Solara API endpoint (`/api/leads/solara`) will automatically:

1. Validate incoming data (name, email, primaryUseCase, solaraComponents required)
2. Store submissions in the `app.solara_interest_modal` table
3. Send comprehensive notification emails to the product team
4. Return success response with lead ID and timestamp

### Email Notifications

The system sends detailed HTML emails including:
- All form data organized by sections
- Lead ID and submission timestamp
- Source attribution (Solara Interest Modal)
- Formatted for easy reading and action

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
- Only service role can access the table
- Email validation is enforced
- IP address and user agent are captured for context
- Priority field for lead scoring

## Monitoring

You can monitor Solara submissions by querying:

```sql
SELECT 
  id, name, company, primary_use_case, solara_components, created_at, status, priority
FROM app.solara_interest_modal 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Submission volume by component interest
- Most requested features and integrations
- Implementation timeline distribution
- Budget range distribution
- Industry and company size patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection failed**
   - Check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Ensure database is accessible

2. **Table already exists**
   - The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
   - Safe to run multiple times

3. **Permission denied**
   - Ensure your database user has CREATE TABLE permissions
   - Check if you're using the correct database role

### Rollback

To remove the table (if needed):

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS app.solara_interest_modal;
```

## Next Steps

After successful migration:

1. Test the Solara modal form submission
2. Verify email notifications are working
3. Set up lead scoring based on priority field
4. Configure CRM integration for product team
5. Set up analytics tracking for modal interactions
