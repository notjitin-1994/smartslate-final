## Running the Migration

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure your database connection is configured in `.env`
2. Make sure you have the required environment variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```

### Execute Migration

Run the migration using the npm script:

```bash
npm run migrate:demo
```

Or directly with tsx:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-demo-table.ts
```

### Verification

After running the migration, you should see:

1. âœ… Success message confirming table creation
2. ðŸ“‹ Table structure listing all columns
3. ðŸ”— Confirmation that the table is ready to receive submissions

## API Integration

The Demo API endpoint (`/api/leads/demo`) will automatically:

1. Validate incoming data (name, email, company, demoType, preferredDate, preferredTime, productInterest required)
2. Validate email format and preferred date is in the future
3. Store submissions in the `app.demo_requests` table
4. Send comprehensive notification emails to the sales team
5. Return success response with request ID and timestamp

### Email Notifications

The system sends detailed HTML emails including:
- All form data organized by sections
- Request ID and submission timestamp
- Source attribution (Demo Request Modal)
- Formatted for easy reading and action by sales team

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) is enabled
- Only service role can access the table
- Email validation is enforced
- Date validation ensures future dates only
- IP address and user agent are captured for context
- Priority field for lead scoring

## Monitoring

You can monitor demo requests by querying:

```sql
SELECT 
  id, name, company, demo_type, product_interest, preferred_date, status, priority
FROM app.demo_requests 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- Demo request volume by product interest
- Most requested demo types and features
- Scheduling preferences and availability patterns
- Budget range distribution
- Industry and company size patterns
- Conversion rates from demo requests to scheduled demos

## Sales Team Workflow

### Lead Management
- **Priority Scoring** - Based on company size, budget, timeline, urgency
- **Assignment** - Route to appropriate sales team member
- **Follow-up** - Track demo scheduling and outcomes
- **Notes** - Add demo notes and outcomes

### Demo Scheduling
- **Calendar Integration** - Sync with sales team calendars
- **Confirmation Emails** - Automated demo confirmations
- **Reminder System** - Pre-demo reminders and preparation
- **Post-demo Tracking** - Outcomes and next steps

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database connection failed**
   - Check your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Ensure database is accessible

2. **Table already exists**
   - The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
   - Safe to run multiple times

3. **Permission denied**
   - Ensure your database user has CREATE TABLE permissions
   - Check if you're using the correct database role

### Rollback

To remove the table (if needed):

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS app.demo_requests;
```

## Next Steps

After successful migration:

1. Test the demo modal form submission
2. Verify email notifications are working
3. Set up lead scoring based on priority field
4. Configure CRM integration for sales team
5. Set up calendar integration for demo scheduling
6. Create automated follow-up sequences
