Environment Configuration

Overview
This repository now contains only a Next.js frontend. No backend is required.

Environment variables
- None required.

Local development
1) Install dependencies: `npm install`
2) Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3) Open `http://localhost:3000`

Production guidance
- Configure your hosting provider per Next.js docs.
- If you later introduce a backend, document variables in a new file.

Notes
- `docs/env.example` is kept minimal as no variables are needed.
