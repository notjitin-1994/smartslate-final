### SmartSlate Auth Pages UX Audit

Scope: Sign-in and Sign-up experiences rendered via `@stackframe/stack` under `src/app/handler/[...stack]` with overrides from `stack-auth-custom.css` and `stack-auth-animations.css`.

#### What works
- **Visual identity**: Uses brand colors and glassmorphism; dark background matches site aesthetic.
- **Consistency**: Typography tokens (Quicksand/Lato) and color variables are applied globally.
- **Basic responsiveness**: Container is centered and legible on desktop and common mobile widths.
- **Integration**: Neon/Stack Auth handler is wired with minimal surface area for breakage.

#### Gaps and friction
- **Clarity**: Messaging is generic; lacks benefit-oriented copy and contextual hints. Primary CTA labels are minimally descriptive.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Missing skip link and clear `main` landmark; limited ARIA labeling around auth region.
  - Focus states exist but are not consistently applied to all interactive elements.
  - Error feedback is not guaranteed to be announced (no explicit `aria-live`).
- **Visual hierarchy**:
  - Dense form layout; insufficient spacing rhythm between sections (logo/title/form/social/footer).
  - Social sign-in buttons compete visually with primary CTA.
- **Mobile responsiveness**:
  - At ≤360px, spacing can feel cramped; brand panel not adaptive, and inputs approach edge of viewport.
  - Touch target sizing is acceptable but could be more generous.
- **Emotional appeal**:
  - No friendly microcopy; lack of subtle motion makes the flow feel transactional vs. inviting.
  - Background is static on slower devices; no progressive enhancement cues.

#### Missed opportunities
- **Progressive disclosure**: Staggered entrance and inline validation to reduce perceived complexity.
- **Micro-interactions**: Focus/hover micro-elevations, success pulses, and gentle shake for invalid states.
- **Brand storytelling**: A left-hand brand panel with concise value prop and trust cues for desktop/tablet.
- **Performance/accessibility toggles**: Prefer-reduced-motion handling and keyboard-first affordances.

#### Recommendations (implemented in redesign)
- Add a client-side auth layout wrapper with:
  - Framer Motion for staged load-in and responsive spacing.
  - Skip link + `role="main"` around the auth area; maintain strong focus rings.
  - Left brand panel at ≥768px with value prop and subtle trust bullets; hide on small screens.
  - Animated gradient orbs (low-contrast) behind glass container; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Refine hierarchy:
  - Increase spacing between header, form, divider, and secondary actions.
  - De-emphasize social sign-in (secondary style) vs. primary CTA.
- Improve mobile at ≤360px:
  - Tighter container padding rules, ensure inputs do not edge-hug, maintain 44px min touch size.
- Keep all Neon/Stack functionality intact by wrapping, not rewriting, the handler UI.
